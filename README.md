# Unloading-the-Cognitive-Overload-in-Machine-Learning
A complete one stop tutorial from scratch in machine learning, deep learning, computer vision and natural language processing.

> The motivation behind this series is to reduce the cognitive workload on individuals who work with machine learning models. Overwhelming availability of resources both free and paid is doing no justice to the actual learning curve of an individual. A machine learning engineer should be developing products with the AI tools rather than spending years learning this exponentially increasing field. Machine learning involves complex algorithms and large datasets, which can be overwhelming and challenging for someone new in this field to understand and manage. I feel that there is a need to simplify and streamline the process of working with machine learning models so that people can focus on the most important aspects of the task and make better modelling decisions instead of being stuck in machine learning nuances, jargons, and flooding of research papers everyday. This can be achieved by using user-friendly tools, visualizations, and interfaces that help to automate or simplify tasks that would otherwise require significant cognitive effort. The goal is to make machine learning more accessible and user-friendly, while still achieving accurate and effective results.

Highlights of the series:

* The series will be by itself a complete standalone course material with minimal resource hopping as well as limiting opened tabs both in our browser and in our brain.
* The tutorials in this series will be supported by corresponding spelled-out blogs.
* Each individual tutorial will be complete in its entirety with the marriage of concepts with codes. (No more fighting !)
* Follow along, practical project-based learning approach with end-to-end streamlined pipeline supported by visualizations and intuitions.
* Series:
  * Preliminaries and groundwork
    * Python
    * Libraries:
      * Numpy
      * Pandas
      * Matplotlib and Seaborn
  * Machine learning (ML)

**NOTE:**
*1. Content list will be updated regularly as the content materials are finished.*
*2. Content creation and ordering will be random as of now, but complete in its individual concept. Upon completion one can follow a bottom-up approach to learn the material sequentially.*
